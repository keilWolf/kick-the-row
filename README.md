## Further Improvements

The project is just a basic implementation. For the future, i have the following improvements in mind:

- intro page (how to play the game)
- highscore (1, 2, 3)
- different playing modes (easy, hard)

### Playing modes

#### Easy or Optional Stuff

- Highlights and Hints

#### Hard

- Time; after a certain time new lines will come.
- no undo redo
